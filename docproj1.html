            <h3>Context</h3>
            <div>
                <img style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 30px;" src="https://www.applied-computing.org/landing/assets/icons/acf_navy_big.png">

            <p>The Applied Computing Foundation (ACF) is an education-based non-profit organization that teaches technology and entrepreneurship to middle and high school students through its ACF Start-up Team program.

            </p>
            <p>
                An ACF start-up team, composed of coaches and up to four students, participates in a four-season cycle to deliver a technological solution that promotes their business idea and a web page that hosts their business solution. Each season lasts for 14 weeks, during which students and coaches meet for two hours each week at a time established at the beginning of the season. 
            </p>
            <p>Students' ultimate goals are to participate in competitions such as the <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/" target="_blank">Congressional App Challenge</a> and <a href="https://www.conradchallenge.org/" target="_blank">Conrad Challenge</a>, and build their college admission portfolio to share their growth stories and accomplishments.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    To prepare for their classes, ACF start-up coaches participated at weekly team meetings, and scavenged through notes from different start-up teams to account for the various tasks required for achieving the entrepreneurship, technical, and outreach goals. The information was dispersed, and the process was lengthy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It was essential to create a document that shares:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    
                    <li>Learning objectives and task checklists per goal for each season.
                    
                    <li>Classroom readiness checklists for management, instructors, and students for each season.
                    
                    <li>Classroom tools and resources required to support classroom learnings.
                    
                    <li>Best practices for managing the ACF start-up classroom online sessions.
                    </li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Contribution</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on my one-year journey as a part-time ACF start-up coach, I was brought on board to create an onboarding document to improve the ACF start-up coach onboarding experience for each season. I interviewed different ACF start-up coaches and pivoted the document to the user's needs. For instance, besides creating an onboarding document, I also created an ACF Goal tracker template that included specific tasks per goal along with a suggested timeline for each season. The template can be personalized by a team to support their team goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For developing the ACF Start-up Coach Onboarding Guide, I:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    
                    <li>Reviewed the existing content, blogs, and medium articles submitted by different ACF start-up teams and coaches to understand their learning experience.
                    
                    <li>Interviewed different stakeholders including the founders, advisors, and start-up coaches to understand the pain points and challenges for accomplishing the goals for each season.
                    
                    <li>Created checklists and process maps to support the onboarding process for start-up coaches and students.
                    
                    <li>Developed different collaterals and templates to support the ACF start-up classroom learnings to facilitate student project management, time management, and collaboration. 
                    
                    <li>Initiated a style guide to capture key decisions around content styles. </div>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    ACF Onboarding Guide is now the default resource for onboarding new ACF start-up coaches. Every six months, the document will be updated to reflect the learnings of the ACF start-up coaches.
