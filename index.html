                I have around five years of experience in writing technical documentation such as user guides, quick start guides, video scripts, release notes, and knowledge base articles.

            <h2>Onboarding Documentation and Process Workflows</h2>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <div>
            <p>The Applied Computing Foundation (ACF) is an education-based non-profit organization that teaches technology and entrepreneurship to middle and high school students.
                </p>
            <p>
                An ACF start-up team, composed of coaches and up to four students, participates in a four-season cycle to deliver a technological solution that promotes their business idea and a web page that hosts their business solution. Each season lasts for 14 weeks, during which students and coaches meet for two hours each week at a time established at the beginning of the season. 
            </p>
            <p>For students, the end goal is to apply for and compete in different competitions like US Congressional App Challenge and the Conrad Challenge, and develop a personal portfolio that can be used for sharing growth stories in their college admission applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    To prepare for their classes, ACF start-up coaches participated at weekly team meetings, and scavenged through notes from different start-up teams to account for the various tasks required for achieving the entrepreneurship, technical, and outreach goals. The information was dispersed, and the process was lengthy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It was essential to create a document that shares:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    
                    <li>Learning objectives and task checklists per goal for each season.
                    
                    <li>Classroom readiness checklists for management, instructors, and students for each season.
                    
                    <li>Classroom tools and resources required to support classroom learnings.
                    
                    <li>Best practices for managing the ACF start-up classroom online sessions.
                    </li>
                    </ul>

            </div>

            <h3>Contribution</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on my one-year journey as a part-time ACF start-up coach, I was brought on board to create an onboarding document to improve the ACF start-up coach onboarding experience for each season. I interviewed different ACF start-up coaches and pivoted the document to the user's needs. For instance, besides creating an onboarding document, I also created an ACF Goal tracker template that included specific tasks per goal along with a suggested timeline for each season. The template can be personalized by a team to support their team goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Over the course of two months, I:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    
                    <li>Reviewed the existing content, blogs, and medium articles submitted by different ACF start-up teams and coaches to understand their learning experience.
                    
                    <li>Interviewed different stakeholders including the founders, advisors, and start-up coaches to understand the pain points and challenges.
                    
                    <li>Created checklists and process maps to support the onboarding process for start-up coaches and students.
                    
                    <li>Developed different collaterals and templates to support the ACF start-up classroom learnings to facilitate student project management, time management, and collaboration. 
                    
                    <li>Initiated a style guide to capture key decisions around content styles.
                    
                    <li>Created a video script mockup to suggest content must-haves.
                    </li>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>

                    <li>Developed an onboarding document to provide comprehensive training and support for the successful onboarding of an Applied Computing Foundation (ACF) start-up coach. The document received positive feedback from the founders and veteran ACF start-up coaches and is used to onboard new hires. This document will be updated every six months to reflect feedback from ACF start-up coaches. 
                    
                    <li>Collaborating with the team to create a series of videos to improve the onboarding experience.
                    </li>

                 <h3>Proposal</h3>
                 <p>I suggested in my GSoD proposal for CirvuitVerse (CV) creating videos, user instructions, and tutorials that would demonstrate how users (students, hobbyists, and educators) could use the platform to build simulations effectively.
            </p>
                <h3>Project Scope</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Document new features and update documentation for existing features.
                    <li>Improve individual pages and sections for clarity and concision.
                    <li>Add relevant images, gifs, and multimedia to enrich and engage readers.
                    <li>Review the existing content structure for improved consistency, readability, and cohesiveness. 
                    <li>Create video tutorials for improving the onboarding experience.

                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Key Learnings and Deliverables</h3>
            <p>
            When GSoD concluded in December 2020, I had produced video tutorials, and rewritten the complete user documentation for the CV simulator. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Following are some of my accomplishments over the four months:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Produced one explainer video and six instructional videos, with voice-over and organization branding, for improving the onboarding experience of CircuitVerse(CV) users. These videos can be reused by the educators (primary audience) while planning their classroom assignments.
                <li>Revised the entire user documentation (approx. 130 pages) for the CV simulator interface by adding content for new features and functionalities, incorporating  figures, tables, and GIFs as visual aids for concept illustration.
                <li>Studied the queries received across CV Slack channel and CV forums to understand user pain points, and added different support resources to take the burden off the CV mentors. 
                <li>Conducted a gap analysis and categorized existing content into meaningful content types.
                <li>Improved the content hierarchy and flow by adding chapters and subchapters for making the content more searchable.
                <li>Generated markdown files for the user documentation before uploading it into GitHub.
            </li>
            </ul>
